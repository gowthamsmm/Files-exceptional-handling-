        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "   * Compiled: Code translated to machine language before running. Faster\n",
        "     execution, less portable.\n",
        "   * Interpreted: Code translated to machine language line by line while\n",
        "     running. Slower execution, more portable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "   * Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows you to gracefully deal with errors that occur during the execution of your program. Instead of the program crashing abruptly, you can anticipate these errors, handle them in a specific way, and allow your program to continue running (or terminate more cleanly).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "   * The purpose of the finally block in Python's exception handling is to ensure that a specific block of code is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised in the try block or not, and regardless of whether that exception was handled by an except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "   * Logging in Python is a built-in module that provides a flexible and powerful way to track events that occur while your software runs. Instead of just printing information to the console (which can be overwhelming and difficult to manage in larger applications), logging allows you to record messages of varying severity to different destinations, such as files, the console, network services, or even email.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "   * The __del__ method in Python is a special method (also called a destructor) that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage-collected, typically when it goes out of scope or has no more references. Its significance lies in allowing developers to define cleanup actions for an object, such as releasing resources (e.g., closing files, network connections, or freeing memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "   * import module: Brings the whole module in. You access things using module.item. Keeps your code organized, avoids name clashes.\n",
        "   * from module import item: Brings specific items directly. You use them by\n",
        "     name. Can be shorter but might cause name clashes if items have the same name as something else.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "   * In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions using a single try block with multiple except clauses, a tuple of exceptions in a single except clause, or a combination of both. This allows you to manage different types of errors gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "   * The with statement in Python is used when handling files to simplify resource management and ensure that files are properly opened and closed, even if an error occurs. It provides a clean and automatic way to manage file resources by handling setup and cleanup tasks, making code safer and more concise.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "   * Multithreading:\n",
        "     * Runs multiple threads in the same program, sharing memory.\n",
        "     * Good for tasks that wait (e.g., downloading files, reading data).\n",
        "     * Limited by Pythonâ€™s GIL (only one thread runs at a time for CPU tasks).\n",
        "     * Example: Multiple threads reading different files at once.\n",
        "   * Multiprocessing:\n",
        "     * Runs multiple processes, each with its own memory and interpreter.\n",
        "     * Good for heavy calculations (e.g., processing images, math tasks).\n",
        "     * No GIL, so it uses multiple CPU cores for true parallelism.\n",
        "     * Example: Multiple processes crunching numbers separately.\n",
        "   * Difference:\n",
        "     * Threads share memory, are lighter, but GIL slows CPU tasks.\n",
        "     * Processes are independent, heavier, but truly parallel for CPU work.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "    * Logging transforms a program from a black box that either works or crashes into a system that provides valuable insights into its operation, making development, debugging, monitoring, and maintenance significantly easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "     * Memory management in Python is the process by which the Python interpreter automatically allocates and deallocates memory as your program runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "    * The basic steps involved in exception handling in Python follow a structured approach using the try, except, and optionally finally blocks:\n",
        "      * try: Put the code that might fail here.\n",
        "      * except: Specify how to handle different types of errors that might occur in the try block.\n",
        "      * finally (optional): Define code that should always run, whether an error occurred or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "    * Memory management is crucial in Python for several key reasons, all contributing to the stability, efficiency, and ease of development of Python programs:\n",
        "      * Preventing Memory Leaks\n",
        "      * Simplifying Development\n",
        "      * Ensuring Program Stability\n",
        "      * Improving Resource Utilization\n",
        "      * Facilitating High-Level Programming\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "    * try: This is where you put the code that might cause an error (an\n",
        "     \"exception\").\n",
        "\n",
        "    * except: If something does go wrong inside the try block, the code in the\n",
        "     corresponding except block is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "    * Python's garbage collection system primarily works through two main mechanisms, working in tandem to automatically manage memory:\n",
        "      * Reference Counting (Immediate Cleanup): Python keeps a little counter on each \"thing\" (object) that says how many other \"things\" are currently pointing to it. When that counter drops to zero, it's like saying nobody needs this anymore, so Python immediately takes it away to free up space.\n",
        "      * Generational Garbage Collector (Dealing with Clingy Groups): Sometimes, you have groups of \"things\" that are all pointing at each other, but nobody outside the group cares about them anymore. Their counters might not go to zero. The generational garbage collector is like a periodic sweep.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "    * The else block in Python's exception handling has a specific and somewhat less common purpose: it executes only if no exceptions were raised in the try block.\n",
        "      * Separating Success Code\n",
        "      * Avoiding Accidental Exception Catching\n",
        "      * Logical Flow\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "    * The logging module in Python defines a standard set of logging levels to indicate the severity or importance of a log message. These levels allow you to filter and control which messages are displayed or recorded based on their significance.\n",
        "      * DEBUG (Numeric value: 10)\n",
        "      * INFO (Numeric value: 20)\n",
        "      * WARNING (Numeric value: 30)\n",
        "      * ERROR (Numeric value: 40)\n",
        "      * CRITICAL (Numeric value: 50)\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "    * os.fork() and multiprocessing allow you to create new processes, multiprocessing offers a more robust, cross-platform, and easier-to-manage approach for most parallel programming needs in Python due to its independent memory spaces and higher-level synchronization primitives. os.fork() is a lower-level tool primarily available on Unix-like systems and requires more careful handling of shared resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "    * Closing files is about being a responsible programmer who manages resources effectively, ensures data integrity, and avoids potential conflicts with other processes or the operating system itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "    * file.read(): This method reads the entire scroll at once and returns it as a single string. If you don't specify a size argument, it will read until the end of the file. If you provide a size (e.g., file.read(10)), it will read at most that many bytes.\n",
        "    * file.readline(): This method reads only a single line from the scroll. It reads characters until it encounters a newline character (\\n) or the end of the file. It returns the line as a string, including the newline character if present. If you call it again, it will read the next line.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "    * The logging module in Python is used for tracking events that happen when your software runs. Think of it as a way for your program to keep a detailed diary of what it's doing, including normal operations, errors, warnings, and debugging information.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "    * The os module in Python plays a crucial role in file handling by providing a way to interact with the operating system itself. It gives you functions to perform various file and directory-related tasks that are independent of the specific files' contents.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "    * The challenges associated with memory management in Python:\n",
        "      * Memory Leaks (Indirectly)\n",
        "      * Memory Fragmentation\n",
        "      * Copying of Mutable Objects\n",
        "      * Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n",
        "      * Interaction with C Extensions\n",
        "      * Garbage Collection Pauses\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "    * You can manually raise an exception in Python using the raise statement.\n",
        "      * Raising a New Exception Instance: You can raise instances of built-in exception classes (like ValueError, TypeError, IOError, etc.) or your own custom exception classes (which should inherit from the base Exception class).\n",
        "      * Raising an Existing Exception (Reraising): Reraising an exception with raise preserves the original exception type and traceback, which is helpful for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "    * Multithreading is a valuable tool for improving the responsiveness and efficiency of applications, especially those that are I/O-bound or need to maintain a responsive user interface while performing background work. However, it's essential to handle the complexities of thread synchronization carefully and to understand its limitations, particularly the impact of the GIL in CPython for CPU-bound tasks."
